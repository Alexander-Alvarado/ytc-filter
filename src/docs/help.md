##### How to block or report people?


ytcFilter integrates Youtube's block/report button. In order to access it, you need to click on the message in embedded ytcFilter to display the message's actions. It will be the 3 dots button, if present.

Note that there is a number of limitation due to Youtube:
* If the message hasn't appeared yet, the button will not be present
* In order for Youtube to work properly, ytcFilter must remove those buttons from itself if they are too old
* Due to Youtube's poor performance, the button may be missing in ytcFIlter
* Refresh if broken.
